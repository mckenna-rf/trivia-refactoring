<!-- # trivia-refactoring
# refactoring process:
# created nonRandom file to test for randomness in trivia.py
# eliminated duplicate code in various methods (was_correctly_answered(), roll(), etc..) by creating new methods to simplify code (nextPlayer(), newLocation())
# created txt file (correct.txt) to store correct output of original trivia.py file and use to compare with refactored code
# implemented loops in methods to reduce duplicate code (ex: for loop in current_player()) -->
